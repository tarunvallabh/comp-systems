## Project 1 - Elementary Logic Gates

### Description

In this project, I have implemented several logic chips in HDL and tested their functionality using the provided test scripts. Below is a list of the chips that have been implemented: 

	1.	Not
	2.	And
	3.	Or
	4.	Xor
	5.	Not16
	6.	And16
	7.	Or16
	8.	Or8Way
	9.	Mux
	10.	DMux
	11.	Mux16
	12.	Mux4Way16
	13.	Mux8Way16
	14.	DMux4Way
	15.	DMux8Way

### Functionality

All implemented chips work as intended. There are no known issues or failures in functionality.
