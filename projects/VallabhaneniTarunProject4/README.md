## Project 4 - Assembly Language Programming

### Description

In this project, I have implemented two programs in the Assembly Language: 

1. **Mult.asm:** This program multiplies the values found in memory location 0 (R0) and memory location 1 (R1) and stores the result in memory location 2 (R2)
2. **Fill.asm:** When any key is pressed, the program blackens the screen. When no key is pressed, the program clears the screen backwards, starting at the end of the black section. 

### Functionality

Both programs work as intended. There are no known issues or failures in functionality.
