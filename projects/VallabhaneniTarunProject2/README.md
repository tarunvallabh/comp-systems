## Project 2 - Combinational Chips

### Description

In this project, I have implemented several logic chips in HDL and tested their functionality using the provided test scripts. Below is a list of the chips that have been implemented: 

	1.	HalfAdder
	2.	FullAdder
	3.	Add16
	4.	Inc16
	5.	ALU

### Functionality

All implemented chips work as intended. There are no known issues or failures in functionality.
