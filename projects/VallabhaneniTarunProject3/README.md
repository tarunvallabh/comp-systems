## Project 3 - Sequential Chips

### Description

In this project, I have implemented several logic chips in HDL and tested their functionality using the provided test scripts. Below is a list of the chips that have been implemented: 

	1.	Bit (folder a)
	2.	Register (folder a)
	3.	RAM8 (folder a)
	4.	RAM64 (folder a)
	5.	RAM512 (folder b)
	6.  RAM4K (folder b)
	7.  RAM16K (folder b)
	8.  PC (Program Counter) (folder a)

### Functionality

All implemented chips work as intended. There are no known issues or failures in functionality.
