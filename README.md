# Nand2Tetris - Student Coursework Repository
Welcome to my GitHub repository for Introduction to Computer Systems! As a student who has recently completed this course, adapted from the Nand2Tetris syllabus, I've compiled all my projects and notes here. This repository serves as a showcase of my journey through the course, where I built a general-purpose computer system from the ground up, and explored the key ideas and techniques in hardware and software system design.

## Overview
This course was a hands-on exploration into the world of computing, from basic logic gates to the complexities of a high-level programming language. I engaged with every aspect of system design, learning valuable skills and gaining a comprehensive understanding of how modern computing systems function.

## Methodology
Throughout this course, I followed a practical approach, implementing each hardware and software module as specified in the coursework. I used a Hardware Description Language (HDL) for hardware modules and chose Python to implement the software projects, allowing me to gain valuable skills in system design, testing, and implementation.

## Projects
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a week's project, complete with Python code and documentation. Here's a brief overview of what I accomplished each week:
- ### Week 1: Boolean Logic and Chip Design
  - Boolean Logic: Developed basic logic gates using Nand gates, all coded in HDL.
  - Chip Design: Utilized Karnaugh maps for efficient circuit design.
- ### Week 2: Boolean Logic and Chip Design
  - Boolean Arithmetic: Constructed an Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU).
  - Memory: Created a memory hierarchy from flip-flops to RAM units.
- ### Week 3: Machine Language and Computer Architecture
  - Machine Language: Wrote low-level programs in assembly language.
  - Computer Architecture: Integrated chips into a functioning computer (Hack computer).
- ### Week 4: Assembler
  - Built an assembler, translating symbolic instructions to binary codes.
- ### Week 5: Virtual Machine I
  - Developed a program to translate VM commands into assembly code.
- ### Week 6: Virtual Machine II
  - Enhanced the VM translator to support branching and subroutine handling.
- ### Week 7: High-Level Language
  - Programmed a computer game in the Jack language.
- ### Week 8: Compiler I
  - Implemented a syntax analyzer for the Jack language.
- ### Week 9: Compiler II
  - Completed a full-scale compiler translating Jack programs into VM code.
 
## Reflections
This course was a profound learning experience for me, blending theoretical concepts with practical applications. I've developed a deeper understanding of computer systems, and this repository stands as a record of my progress and achievements.

Feel free to explore the folders and delve into the specifics of each project. I hope my work can provide insights or assistance to anyone interested in the field of computer systems.
